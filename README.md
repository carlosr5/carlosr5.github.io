# Tribute Page
Tribute Page for the FreeCodeCademy HTML/CSS course

I'm making this tribute page towards Sal Khan, the person behind KhanAcademy. He's helped millions of students get by in school, as well as delivered quality, free education to those who can't go to school. He's impacted millions, and I wanted to make this project dedicated to him.

This is my first project in HTML/CSS, so my website looks pretty outdated. This was a great learning experience, though, and I hope to take the lessons I learned from this to future projects.

What I learned:
<ul>
	<li>Making a website that looks good is not as intuitive as I thought.</li>
	<li>Organizing everything into separate divs makes design generally easier</li>
	<li>The process takes a lot of time without structure, so it's a good idea to plan out what you want in your site</li>
</ul>
